## For mod reviewers and reposters

When reposting my mod on your own website or reviewing it, please consider following (if you want to support me and my mod):

* Don't distort the mod name. It's the *<?php echo $links[$project]['title'] ?>* mod.
* Make sure that information and description of my mod is legit. Misleading information, like Minecraft version support or non-existent features, is your responsibility.
* By uploading a custom build of this mod, the build becomes your responsibility.
* Provide the source link, please. [CurseForge](<?php echo $links[$project]['curse'] ?>) page is preferable.
* Provide a link to my [YouTube channel](<?php echo $links['youtube'] ?>), please. This will be really appreciated! 
* You can use <?php echo $links[$project]['title'] ?> [banner](<?php echo $links[$project]['banner'] ?>) or [cover](<?php echo $links[$project]['cover'] ?>) for your repost page. Don't apply the watermark, though, that's just rude.
