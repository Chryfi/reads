## For reposters

When reposting my mod on your own website, please do following (if you want to support me and this mod):

* Don't distort the mod name. It's the *<?php echo $links[$project]['title'] ?>* mod.
* Make sure that information and description of my mod is legit. Misleading information, like Minecraft version support or non-existent features, is your responsibility.
* By uploading a custom build of this mod, the build becomes your responsibility.
* Provide the source link, please. Either it's GitHub page, Planet Minecraft, Minecraft Forum post or CurseForge page.
* You can use <?php echo $links[$project]['title'] ?> [banner](<?php echo $links[$project]['banner'] ?>) or [cover](<?php echo $links[$project]['cover'] ?>) for your repost page. Don't apply the watermark, though, that's just rude.

## For YT reviewers

When reviewing my mod on your YT channel, please do following (if you want to support me and this mod):

* Don't distort the mod name. It's the *<?php echo $links[$project]['title'] ?>* mod.
* Provide a link to my [YouTube channel](<?php echo $links['youtube'] ?>), please. This will be really appreciated! 
* Provide the source link instead of reposter's page, please. Either it's GitHub page, Planet Minecraft or Minecraft forum post. However, if you have a website where you post some notes or instructions along with link to source link, it's also fine. AdFly link will be really appreciated!
