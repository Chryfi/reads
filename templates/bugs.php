## Bug reports

If you found a bug, or this mod crashed your game, make sure to check this [compatibility table and incompatible mod list](https://github.com/mchorse/mclib/wiki/Compatibility-table-of-McHorse%27s-mods) page. The most frequent issue people encounter is that they didn't install the compatible versions of my mods. Or updated only one mod while using older version of my other mods.

If the versions of the mod are correct, then you can report a bug or a crash to me either on [issue tracker](<?php echo $links[$project]['github'] ?>/issues/), or on my [Discord server](<?php echo $links['discord'] ?>). Please, make sure to attach a crash log ([pastebin](http://pastebin.com) please) and description of a bug or crash, and the way to reproduce it. Thanks!
