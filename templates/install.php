## Install

Install [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/), download the latest stable version of jar file for available minecraft version. Put it in minecraft's `mods` folder, and launch the game.

After that, <?php echo $links[$project]['title'] ?> mod should be installed and will appear in Minecraft's mods menu. If <?php echo $links[$project]['title'] ?> didn't appear in the mods menu, then something went wrong.
