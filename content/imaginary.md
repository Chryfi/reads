This mod supports any formats that Minecraft supports for textures (**PNG**, **JPEG** and **GIF** without animations). This mod is built for Minecraft 1.10.2 and Forge 12.18.3.2185.

After you acquired a picture item, you should be able to place a custom picture on any surface. When picture is placed, you can right click it and change some properties of your picture. To pick a picture, you'll have to populate Imaginary's mod picture folder (which is located in `.minecraft/config/imaginary/pictures`) with your **PNG**, **JPEG** or **GIF** pictures. After you dropped your pictures into the pictures folder, you should be able to pick these pictures in picture's GUI.
