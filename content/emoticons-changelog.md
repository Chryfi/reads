# Change Log

Emoticons's change log.

## Version 0.3

This long update took long quite long to get finished, and I don't think I actually got done anything finished, but here we go.

**Compatible** with McLib **1.0.3** and optionally with Blockbuster **1.6** and Metamorph **1.1.8**. It doesn't mean that future versions of McLib, Blockbuster and Metamorph would be incompatible, but older versions are most likely incompatible.

* Added new emotes: Get Funky, Free Flow, Shimmer, Twerk and Clubbing
* Added new mod dependency **McLib**
* Added simplified models
* Added config option to disable sound event registering
* Added 2 more emote keybinds
* Added Emoticons morph editor to support full configuration of morphs
* Added Emoticons morph animated poses
* Changed different model shading method
* Fixed crash with some strict graphics card drivers
* Fixed crash with dedicated server and morphs

## Version 0.2.1

Third update. This quick patch provides few important tweaks. This update removed the F1 watermark, fixes dying animation not showing up during emote, adds empty sound events for dances, adds an option in emote configuration menu to disable non-emote animations, decreased the file size of the jar, and finally added extra information on the crash screen (so it would be easy to understand what's going on with access key).

## Version 0.2

Includes support for vanilla armor, a tweak to emote key binds (which allows changing to another emote without stopping an emote), and also 10 new emotes: Fist, Gangnam Style, Pointing, Gopak aka Squat Kick (suggested by Andruxioid), Salute, Skibidi, Shrug, T-pose, Take the L and Rock-paper-scissors.

## Version 0.1

Initial release of Emoticons mod (which was rebranded from Fortcraft before release). This inlcludes 4 emote keybinds, 28 emotes and substitute animations for player model.
