**Mappet** is a Minecraft mod (for **1.12.2** exclusively) that is designed as a tool set for far superior adventure maps than possible with vanilla. It's also possible to use Mappet for scripted roleplays, and, to some extent, in Minecraft machinimas.

Special thanks to [Andruxioid](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnHOceBjwMyqCR5oYOoNqhQ) for the mod's name, Jvonlins, Centryfuga and [CustomNPCs Forever Vkontakte](https://vk.com/customnpcforever) group for testing, suggestions and directing!
