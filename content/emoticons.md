**Emoticons** is a aesthetic Minecraft mod which adds custom player animations (which supports bends) and emote system. At the moment of release, there are **52** emotes which can be triggered by the player using key binds which comes with the mod. Beside that, that's all what the mod does.
Check out this playlist for more showcase of the mod.

## F.A.Q.

**Q: Can you add custom music to emotes?**  
A: No, because I have no time/skill to make cool tunes for every emote, and if I use the original audio that would be illegal. However, you can make your own custom resource pack or place the sounds to Emoticons' jar, and replace the emoticons sound events.

**Q: I don't like Emoticons' animations, but emotes are very cool. Can I disable them?**  
A: You can disable them in 0.2.1 in the emote configuration menu.

**Q: I'm playing with my friends on the server, and why I can't see them emote, or they can't see me emote?**  
A: In order to see other people emote, the server must also install the mod. No mod on the server, no people emoting.

**Q: Can you add support with mod X?**  
A: No, I won't add support with any other mods. This mod was made for fun, I don't want to turn it into my job.

**Q: Can I add custom emotes myself?**  
A: No, you can't.

**Q: Will you upgrade mod to 1.7.10, 1.8 or 1.9?**  
A: No, those versions are not supported by Forge, and generally dead (not player-wise, modder-wise).

**Q: Will you upgrade mod to 1.10.2 or 1.11.2?**  
A: Only if there will be a big demand.

**Q: Will you upgrade mod to 1.13 or up?**  
A: No, due to drastic changes to Minecraft and Forge code, I can't afford spending months updating my mods to up-to-date versions. However, there is [Badlion Client](http://bit.ly/2Z2zBbw) which supports emotes on 1.7.10, 1.8.9, 1.12.2, 1.14.4 and multiple branches of 1.15.

**Q: I've seen emotes exactly like yours in Badlion Client. Do you know about it?**  
A: Yes, I know, in fact I'm currently a developer for Badlion Client, so yeah, I helped to integrated the client side aspect of the mod into the client.
