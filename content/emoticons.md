## FAQ

**Q: I don't like Emoticons' animations, but emotes are very cool. Can I disable them?**  
A: You can disable them in McLib's dashboard (Ctrl + 0, check for conflicting keybinds in Options - Controls, if it doesn't work) by enabling **Disable non-emote animations** toggle option.

**Q: Will you downgrade/upgrade mod to other version of Minecraft?**  
A: No. It's gonna stay 1.12.2 (and 1.8.9) only.

**Q: I'm using 1.8.9 version and it says something about "mclib"?**  
A: You need to install [McLib for 1.8.9](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mchorses-mclib/files/3102750) so it would work.

**Q: I'm playing with my friends on the server, and why I can't see them emote, or they can't see me emote?**  
A: In order to see other people emote, the server must also install the mod. No mod on the server, no people emoting.

**Q: Can you add support with mod X?**  
A: No, I won't add support with any other mods.

**Q: Can I add custom emotes myself?**  
A: Yes, watch [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/dhSYT2HEweM) video! Those are not synchronized across clients though. You'll have to manually send these emote files to other people.

**Q: I've seen emotes exactly like yours in an X client. Do you know about it?**  
A: Most likely I know about this, as I gave permission to use the mod's source in their client. The known clients to me are Badlion and Lunar.

**Q: Can you add custom music to emotes?**  
A: No, because I have no time/skill to make cool tunes for every emote, and if I use the original audio that would be illegal. However, you can replace the sounds in Emoticons' jar. Keep in mind that these sounds are going to loop.
